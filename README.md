# FE Project Simple Milestones

## The Project

Please create a small and light wight application to handle, insert and update milestones. The frontend should have a very small interface to add and update milestones. And a part to view them in a list with start and end date.

### The add/update form

- Project name
- Name of milestone
- start date
- end date
- completed flag

### The milestone list view

- List of all milestones
- Smart view of the start and end date
- Button to compelte or edit a milestone
- Hide completed milestones (there should be an option to view them again)

## Tools

Please use the following tools to create this project

- React
- Redux
- SaaS
- GIT

## Data

Feel free to use any kind of database to store the milestones. It is also allowed to use an API to use a remote (non-local) database. This may even be the best idea.
